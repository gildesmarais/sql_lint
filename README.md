# SqlLint: Your SQL Quality Guardian for Rails

## Catch SQL Pitfalls Early, Boost Performance, and Streamline Development

SqlLint is a **minimalist, RuboCop-style SQL linter** designed to seamlessly integrate with your Rails test suite. It automatically catches common and DBMS-specific SQL pitfalls, helping you **write more robust, performant, and secure SQL queries** right when you're developing them.

## Why SqlLint? Empowering Developers with Proactive SQL Quality

Databases are critical, yet SQL-related issues often surface late in the development cycle, leading to costly fixes and performance bottlenecks. SqlLint addresses this by providing **proactive, real-time feedback** directly within your Rails test suite. This empowers you to:

- **Prevent Performance Regressions**: Catch missing `LIMIT` clauses before they hit production.
- **Avoid Data Anomalies**: Be warned about potentially unsafe `UNION` usage.
- **Ensure Cross-DBMS Compatibility**: Leverage adapter-specific rules for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Streamline Code Reviews**: Automate tedious SQL review points, freeing up your team.
- **Boost Developer Confidence**: Write SQL knowing common mistakes are being checked.

## Quick Start

Getting started with SqlLint is straightforward.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'sql_lint'
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Usage

1.  **Integrate with Rails:** Create an initializer file in `config/initializers/sql_lint.rb`:

    ```ruby
    # config/initializers/sql_lint.rb
    if Rails.env.test?
      require "sql_lint"

      # Subscribe to Active Record's SQL notifications
      ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("sql.active_record") do |_, _, _, _, payload|
        SqlLint::Runner.run(payload[:sql])
      end
    end
    ```

2.  **Run Your Test Suite:** Simply execute your tests as usual (e.g., `bin/rails test`, `rspec`).

    Lint warnings will appear directly in your **STDOUT**, making them easy to spot during development.

## Features at a Glance

SqlLint comes packed with intelligent checks to safeguard your SQL:

- **Missing `LIMIT` Detection**: Warns when `SELECT` statements might pull excessively large result sets, preventing performance hits.
- **Unsafe `UNION` Usage**: Flags `UNION` operations that lack the `ALL` keyword, which can lead to unintended deduplication and performance overhead.
- **Multi-DBMS Support**: Ships with robust rule sets for:
  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **MySQL**
  - **SQLite**
  - **Adapter-agnostic** (default) rules that apply across databases.
- **Seamless Rails Integration**: Hooks directly into `ActiveRecord`'s SQL notifications, requiring minimal setup.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for growth, SqlLint makes it straightforward to add your own custom checker rules. This modularity is perfect for extending its capabilities and tailoring it to unique project needs, making it an ideal area for community contributions.

## Configuration

SqlLint offers a flexible, RuboCop-inspired configuration system. Control which checks run using a `.sql_lint.yml` file at your project's root.

### Example `.sql_lint.yml`

```yaml
# Disable all PostgreSQL-specific checks
PostgreSQL:
  Enabled: false

# Disable a specific default check
Default/SelectWithoutLimit:
  Enabled: false

# Optimize performance by enabling parallel execution of checks
Runner:
  Parallel: true
```

### How Configuration Works

- **Default Behavior**: All checkers are **enabled by default** for immediate comprehensive linting.
- **Merging Logic**: Your `.sql_lint.yml` is intelligently merged with the default settings.
- **Granular Control**:
  - Disable **entire categories** (e.g., `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `Default`) by setting `Enabled: false`.
  - Disable **individual checkers** by their full name (e.g., `Default/SelectWithoutLimit`).
  - Enable or disable **parallel runner execution** for faster linting on larger test suites by setting `Runner.Parallel: true`.
- **Implicit Enablement**: If a checker or category isn't specified in your config, it remains enabled by default.

This flexible system provides **fine-grained control** over your SQL linting rules, tailored to your project's specific needs.

## Getting Started with Development

Ready to dive into SqlLint's codebase? Here's how to get your development environment set up quickly. You'll need Ruby 3.3.x and Docker installed.

### 1. Set Up the Database and Run Tests

Simply start the PostgreSQL database and run the test suite using Docker Compose. The `app` service will automatically build the Ruby environment, install dependencies, and execute the tests.

```sh
docker compose up -d db
docker compose run app
```

To run RuboCop for linting:

```sh
docker compose run app bundle exec rubocop
```

When you're finished, you can stop the PostgreSQL container:

```sh
docker compose down
```

If you prefer to work with a shell, try:

```sh
docker compose run --rm app /bin/bash
```
